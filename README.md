#NativeScript Cuteness Sample

The Cuteness application is a viewer for the [aww reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww), built with [the NativeScript framework](http://www.nativescript.org).

Cuteness is a proof of concept app that demonstrates NativeScript's capabilities. It uses JavaScript-to-native APIs to build native User Interfaces for best UX and common JavaScript (Native Script Modules - NSM) to abstract platform differences.
